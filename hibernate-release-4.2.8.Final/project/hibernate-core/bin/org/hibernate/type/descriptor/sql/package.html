    Defines handling of the standard <tt>JDBC</tt>-defined types, as declared by {@link java.sql.Types}.
</p>
<p>
    We omit certain <tt>JDBC</tt> types here solely because Hibernate does not use them itself, not due to any
    inability to provide proper descriptors for them.  Known omissions include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link java.sql.Types#ARRAY ARRAY}</li>
    <li>{@link java.sql.Types#DATALINK DATALINK}</li>
    <li>{@link java.sql.Types#DISTINCT DISTINCT}</li>
    <li>{@link java.sql.Types#STRUCT STRUCT}</li>
    <li>{@link java.sql.Types#REF REF}</li>
    <li>{@link java.sql.Types#JAVA_OBJECT JAVA_OBJECT}</li>
</ul>
